The muppy project has been merged into the [Pympler project](http://code.google.com/p/pympler/). Any future development of muppy related code is done in Pympler. Please do not use muppy anymore as the code is stale not not supported anymore.

A word about Pympler: _Pympler integrates three previously separate modules into a single, comprehensive profiling tool. The asizeof module provides basic size information for one or several Python objects, the module muppy is used for on-line monitoring of a Python application and the module tracker provides off-line analysis of the lifetime of selected Python objects._
